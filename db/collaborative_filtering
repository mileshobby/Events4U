EventRecommendationEngine

Algorithm: collaborative filtering

two ways: by in common events of two diff users or by similarity of events of single user

User1 = 1
User2 = 2
Tickets = T
Saved Events = S

((T1) intersecion (T2) / () )

Jaccard Similarity Index:

((num unique events that BOTH users purchased or saved) / (total num unique events that EITHER user purchased or saved)


num all unique events:

current_user_events = Set.new (current_user.purchased_events.concat(User1.bookmarked_events).unique)
other_user_events = Set.new (other_user.purchased_events.concat(User2.bookmarked_events).unique)

events_intersection = other_user.intersection other_user
events_union = other_user.union other_user_events
